# Product Seeking
### Problem Definition
Given a textual query, Product Seeking aims to localize the image-level product from the gallery (Product Retrieval) and object-level product on an image (Product Grounding).

### Datasets
To research the Product Seeking with great practical application value, we collect two large-scale benchmark datasets TMPS and TLPS from Taobao Mall and Taobao Live domains with about 474k image-title pairs and 101k frame-description pairs respectively, and the locations of object-level products in images are manually annotated. 

**Now, you can download [dataset demo](https://tao-grounding.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Dataset%20demo.zip)(5MB), [partial instances]() [annotations](https://tao-grounding.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Data%20annotations.zip)(29MB). After acceptance, we will realise the full datasets** and inspire active research and discussion in the related community.
